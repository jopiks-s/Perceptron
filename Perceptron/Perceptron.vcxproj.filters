# This script is intended to be run by the ORAchk health-check tool
# as an OS CHECK operation, to parse the output from the OS COLLECT
# task which ran "cluster check". This avoids the need to include all
# this bash code, duplicated, in each check.
#
# This script ships with both ORAchk and Solaris Cluster. ORAchk will
# always invoke the script it ships but, in case the installed cluster
# software has a more recent version, we check and will use the cluster
# one if it is newer.
#
# Note that this "version" variable *must* always be incremented
# if this script is changed, and a copy of the new script supplied to
# the ORAchk team. See the README in the cluster source directory for
# details.

# This script parses both *single node* checks, those which begin
# with a letter "S", and *multinode* checks, those which begin with
# a letter "M"
#
# Although parsing XML is arguably easier in Perl with something
# like XML::Parser, the small amount of parsing that needs to be
# done makes the use of standard shell scripting acceptable, and
# more convenient.

# Takes one parameter which can be either:
# $1 = the lowercase string "version", the script will exit with
#      the current version number, or:
# $1 = a single check number, one of the list given to OS COLLECT
#
# The script will print a text status to stdout, which will be a
# report containing the status of the check on each cluster node,
# This report must be caught a
